                   <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                   <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies.</p>
                   <p>The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia,[3] where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.</p>
                   <p>Gemsbok live in herds of about 10â€“40 animals, which consist of a dominant male, a few nondominant males, and females. They are mainly desert-dwelling and do not depend on drinking water to supply their physiological needs. They can reach running speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph).</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                   <P>You will find the Gemsbok at pen A5, right next to the lake.</P>
